# MalwareVisualization
This is a visualization of the different types of malware you might encounter on the internet and their geographic origins.

## Setup
You will first need to generate a google maps api key from https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_backend,geocoding_backend,directions_backend,distance_matrix_backend,elevation_backend,places_backend&reusekey=true&pli=1. Then create ```keys.ts``` at the root of the project directory (the same location as this readme) with the following code:

```
export const keys = {
  maps: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'
};

```

## Development server

Run `npm start` to start the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application;
