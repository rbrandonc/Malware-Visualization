# MalwareVisualization
This is a full stack angular2 project demonstrating the entire continuous integration pipeline needed to test with Travis and deploy an angular app to Heroku. A push to github results in travis CI running all tests on the project, and Heroku updating the app once the tests are passed. Tests are written with karma.

The GUI is simple. A map with a sidebar that contains information on the distribution of malware, as well as a graph showing the amount of the different types of malwares detected over time. Using the tree we can show which malwares show up on the map. Clicking on a map marker will resutlt in the relevant information being shown in the sidebar.

I decided to take on this project because I thought it would be interesting to see where different types of malware originate from around the world. There were a surprising number in the US.

## Setup
You will first need to generate a google maps api key from https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_backend,geocoding_backend,directions_backend,distance_matrix_backend,elevation_backend,places_backend&reusekey=true&pli=1. Then create ```keys.ts``` at the root of the project directory (the same location as this readme) with the following code:

```
export const keys = {
  maps: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'
};

```

Then run ```npm install``` in the command line from the project directory, and your project will be ready to run.

## Development server

Run `npm start` to start the dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to view the application;

## Production

First you must sign up for both Travis CI and Heroku.
