# MalwareVisualization
This is a visualization of the different types of malware you might encounter on the internet and their geographic origins.

## Setup
You will first need to generate a google maps api key from https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_backend,geocoding_backend,directions_backend,distance_matrix_backend,elevation_backend,places_backend&reusekey=true&pli=1. Then create ```keys.js``` at the root of the project directory (the same location as this readme) with the following code:

```
export const keys = {
  maps: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'
};

```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
